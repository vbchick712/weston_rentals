This code was written to learn the Mechanize gem for scraping information off of websites. I chose to scrape rental home data from
Craig's List for 3-bedroom/2-bathroom homes in the 33327 zip code. This code gets that data and creates a csv file to show the listing
name, location, rent amount, and url to the direct listing.

This file is a Ruby file that is meant to be run in the Terminal and is not set up to have an HTML page or server running to view the
results. That might be a future version, but not this time around.
